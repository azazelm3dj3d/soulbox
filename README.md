# Soulbox

Soulbox is a JavaScript library that can generate a simple and lightweight lightbox.

## Usage

Link to the soulbox.js & soulbox.css files in this repository. If you need an example of how to do this in HTML, check in the `/public` directory.

Example:
```html
<!-- Add in the <head> tag -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/soulbox.css">

<!-- After importing, you can use the lightbox like this -->
<div class="card mx-auto shadow">
    <img
        src="path/to/image"
        class="soulbox"
        alt="Soulbox image"
    />
</div>

<!-- Add in the <body> tag -->
<script src="path/to/soulbox.js"></script>
```

This lightbox is no longer being maintained and most likely won't be unless it gets used. For now, it'll be marked as a public archive.
